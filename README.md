Chris's Redesign of Showdown's Damage Calculator
=================================================

Check out the original here!
https://chrisisonline.github.io/pkmn-dmgcalc/

My workflow includes Node.js, Gulp and Sass

Instructions
------------
1. Install node.js
2. run 'npm install' to install packages
3. run 'npm install gulp -g' to install gulp on your machine
4. run 'gulp' to build and host the site
5. open 'public/index.html' or go to 'localhost:8080' in your browser (livereloads upon file changes, gulp must be actively running)

The Goal
--------
You can read my blog to see my design process.
